# Electronics Module Boards Library eXPerience
Various modular-designed electronics boards created for home didactic projects.

![overview](images/overview.jpg)

These MOdule Boards (MOBs) are useful for:
* testing specific components functions
* prototyping complex projects by modular approach
* expanding and interfacing components functions
* fun in building simple circuits


## Contents of the MOBs library
* [ExpressPCB custom components library](expresspcb) containing the ExpressPCB files of schematic and pcb components used for drawing the MOBs layout


## Specifications
Schematics and PCB layouts are designed with ExpressPCB free CAD software.

### MOBs naming convention
* mob (module board)
* mob-psu (power supply unit)
* mob-io (input/output unit)
* mob-if (interface unit)
* mob-fn (function controller unit)
* mob-mcu (micro controller unit)

### PCB Specifications
* PCB layout are designed on paperboard sizes: 2x8cm, 5x7cm, 7x10cm
* Each MOB has the power connector (PWR) with the positive pin on left, a bulk capacitor (C) and a power-on led indicator (DL) (yes, I have surplus of components!)
* Unless otherwise specified, MOBs are 5V
* Activity leds are:
	* 3mm green led for power status indicator
	* 3/5mm green led for normal activity indicator
	* 3/5mm yellow led for warning status indicator
	* 3/5mm red led for error, fault or wrong status indicator
	* 3/5mm blue led for request of manual intervent
* Led current limiter resistors: R=1Kohm
* Digital pin pull-up resistors: R=10Kohm
* IC decoupling capacitors: C=100nF
* Board bulk capacitors: C=10uF

### ExpressPCB Custom Components Library
* ExpressPCB components used for MOBs are customized and named as "_MOB_name__*size*"
* Paperboard layout templates are also saved as ExpressPCB custom components and named as "_MOB__Paperboard_*size*"
* ExpressPCB custom components size units, unless otherwise specified, are 1/10 of inches
* PCB layout traces are 0.05", pads are 0,065"


## Future Plans for the MOBs Library
* Add more MOBs!
* Add a new version of MOB that encapsulates more complex features in a single board
