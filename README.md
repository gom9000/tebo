# Electronics Test Boards Library
Various modular-designed test boards created for home didactic electronics projects.<br>
These boards (TEBO) are useful for:
* testing specific components functions
* prototyping complex projects by modular approach
* expanding and interfacing components functions


## Recent Updates (2018-03-23)
* Add io-matrix-4x4 TEBOs

## Specifications
Schematics and PCB layouts are designed with ExpressPCB free CAD software.

### TEBO naming convention
* tebo (test board)
* tebo-psu (power supply unit tebo)
* tebo-io (input/output tebo)
* tebo-if (interface tebo)
* tebo-fn (function controller tebo)
* tebo-mcu (micro controller unit tebo)

### PCB Specifications
* PCB layout are designed for paperboard sizes: 2x8cm, 5x7cm, 7x10cm
* Each TEBO has the power connector (PWR) with the positive pin on left, a bulk capacitor and a power-on led (yes, I have surplus of components!)
* Led colors and sizes are:
	* 3mm green led for power or (3/5mm) normal activity indicators
	* 3mm yellow led for warning status indicators
	* 3mm red led for error, fault or wrong status indicators
	* 3mm blue led for request for manual intervent
* Led current limiter resistors: R=1Kohm
* Digital pin pull-up resistors: R=10Kohm
* IC decoupling capacitors: C=100nF
* Board bulk capacitors: C=10uF tantalum

### ExpressPCB Custom Conponents Library
* ExpressPCB components used for tebos are customized and named as "_TEBO-name-*size*"
* Paperboard layout templates are also saved as ExpressPCB custom components and named as "_TEBO-Paperboard-*size*"
* Components size units, where not specified, are 1/10 of inches (1/10 of inch = 1 Module Unit)
* PCB traces are 0.05", pads are 0,065"


## Future Plans for the TEBOs Library
* Include photos of built tebos
* Include technical specifications for each tebo
* Add more tebos
