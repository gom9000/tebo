commit form: Maintenance/Feature/Bugfix release


## 1.0.0 "*Basic*" 2019-10-30 Feature release
The "Basic" release collects a set of self-consistent boards (mobs) to provide power supply, provide digital inputs and show outputs of basic electronic projects, perhaps based on Microchip PIC16f6x8.
(used by xp-pic-assembly)
- Added MOB mob-io-7seg-bcd
- Added MOB mob-io-7seg
- Added "Basic" MOBs library overview image




1) ExpressPCB Custom Library:
	rename TEBO custom components to MOB components;
	change Power Jack SCH;
	verify ALL!!!

2) for MOB:
	rename sch & pcb files;
	change "Test Board" with "Module Boards Library";
	change pcb label;
	change TEBO custom components to MOB components;
	create README file with mob description, specifics, built photo, sch and pcb picture, bom and test;
	update mobs-library README file with the new mob.


- old tebo modules:
* [mob-4bit-7seg](mobs/mob-4bit-7seg/) : 7-segment display with BCD input module board
* [mob-8bit-7seg](mobs/mob-8bit-7seg/) : 7-segment display module board

* [tebo-if-midi](https://github.com/gos95-electronics/test-boards-library/tree/master/tebo-if-midi/) : midi-in/out/thru interface v1.3
* [tebo-if-midi-in](https://github.com/gos95-electronics/test-boards-library/tree/master/tebo-if-midi-in/) : midi-in interface v1.3
* [tebo-if-midi-in-x2](https://github.com/gos95-electronics/test-boards-library/tree/master/tebo-if-midi-in-x2/) : two input midi-in interface v1.0
* [tebo-if-midi-out](https://github.com/gos95-electronics/test-boards-library/tree/master/tebo-if-midi-out/) : midi-out interface v1.3
* [tebo-if-midi-out-x2](https://github.com/gos95-electronics/test-boards-library/tree/master/tebo-if-midi-out-x2/) : two output midi-out interface v1.0
